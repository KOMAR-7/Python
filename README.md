"The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code - not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death." - Guido van Rossum

Welcome to your starting point for learning Python. I have created a Python folder that contains two subfolders:

1. Codes: This subfolder includes all the codes necessary for you to practice in Python. Each file has a unique name identifying the concept it covers, for example, p2_operators.py teaches about operators in Python. Other files cover different concepts in Python.

2. Theory: This subfolder contains various chapters that cover different Python concepts. Each chapter includes theoretical knowledge along with examples to help you understand the concepts better. Chapter 1 (Introduction) also provides guidance on the installation process.

We wish you all the best in your journey of learning Python and in life. If you have any queries, feel free to DM me on Instagram (instagram.com/k.omar_7/) or email me (khanomar0417@gmail.com).
