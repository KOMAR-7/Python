# •	Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# •	Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# •	Lists are created using square brackets. List can store value of any data type.
# •	List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# •	List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
# •	When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# •	If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
# •	The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
# •	Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value
